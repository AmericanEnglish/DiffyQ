# Introduction

This project was given to me by my Differential Equations teacher Marco Weidenhoeft. In doing so it will meet requirements that are known to him and I and they will not be posted. Although basic functionality will be listed you could assume that functionality implies requirements. There are going to be matlab routines that will be run in matlab and if given enough time it will be converted into Python *hopefully* using SciPy, Tcl, and/or PyGame.

# Progress
- Done
    - Euler's Method
    - Improve Euler's Method
    - Runge - Kotta Classical 4th Order
- To Do
    - Taylor Series Differentiation
    - Combining All 4
    - Providing Verbose Graphing Options (kind of)
